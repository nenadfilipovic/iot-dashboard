# IOT Dashboard

Complete system that enables you to receive, store and monitor your sensor data.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nenadfilipovic/iot-dashboard
```

### Prerequisites

To use this app user needs to have docker and docker-compose installed on local computer.

If a user want to continue to develop this app in containers, vs-code plugins are also required, like this [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), of course user also need to have wsl2 installed.

### Installing

Installing is simple as running `docker-compose up` inside root folder where docker-compose.yml file is located.

If user want to run it from VS-Code you can install [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension that enables user to run docker files from editor without using docker cli.
